# Bubble Sort Documentation

## Overview

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Algorithm

1. **Start:**
   - Initialize a boolean variable `swapped` to true.

2. **Iterate through the list:**
   - Repeat the following steps until `swapped` is false:
     - Set `swapped` to false.
     - Iterate through the list from the beginning to the second-to-last element.

3. **Compare and swap:**
   - For each pair of adjacent elements, if they are in the wrong order (i.e., `element[i] > element[i+1]`), swap them and set `swapped` to true.

4. **Repeat:**
   - If any swaps were made in the previous pass, repeat the process. Otherwise, the list is sorted, and the algorithm terminates.

## C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Bubble_Sort {
    int size;
    int *arr; 
public:
    Bubble_Sort() {
        cout << "Input array Size: " << endl;
        cin >> size;

        // Dynamically allocate memory for the array
        arr = new int[size];
    }

    ~Bubble_Sort() {
        // Deallocate memory when the object is destroyed
        delete[] arr;
    }

    void input_array() {
        cout << "Input " << size << " values in array: " << endl;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            cin >> arr[i];
            cout << endl;
        }
    }

    void display_array() {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            cout << arr[i] << ", ";
        }
    }

    void swap(int &num1, int &num2) {
        int temp = num1;
        num1 = num2;
        num2 = temp;
    }


    void sort() {
    	bool sorted;
          for(int i=0;i<size;i++){
          	sorted = true;
        	for(int j=1;j<size - i;j++){
         		if(arr[j] < arr[j-1]){
         			swap(arr[j],arr[j-1]);
         			sorted = false;
			}
		}
		if(sorted){
			return;
		}			   
    	}
	}
};
int main() {
    Bubble_Sort array;
    array.input_array();
    array.sort();
    array.display_array();
}


```

## C++ Implementation using `vector` library

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void bubbleSort(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    bool swapped = true;
    while (swapped) {
        swapped = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size() - 1; ++i) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                std::swap(arr[i], arr[i + 1]);
                swapped = true;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> data = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
    
    std::cout << "Original array: ";
    for (int num : data) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    
    bubbleSort(data);
    
    std::cout << "\nSorted array: ";
    for (int num : data) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize a boolean variable `swapped` to true.

2. **First Pass:**
   - Iterate through the list:
     - Compare and swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
     - Update `swapped` if any swaps are made.

3. **Subsequent Passes:**
   - Repeat the process until no swaps are made in a pass, indicating the list is sorted.

4. **Termination:**
   - The algorithm terminates when the entire list is sorted.

## Interview Questions

1. **What is Bubble Sort?**
   - Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. **What is the time complexity of Bubble Sort?**
   - The time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases.

3. **Can Bubble Sort be considered efficient for large datasets? Why or why not?**
   - Bubble Sort is not considered efficient for large datasets because of its quadratic time complexity, making it less suitable for large-scale sorting tasks.
