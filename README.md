# Data Structures and Algorithms using C++

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository** in C++! This open-source project aims to provide a comprehensive resource for learning and mastering DSA concepts, interview questions, theoretical explanations, and practical code examples.

## Repository Overview

### Coverage

Our repository covers a wide range of topics, including:

- **Data Structures**: Detailed explanations and implementations of common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.

- **Algorithms**: In-depth explanations and implementations of fundamental algorithms, including searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms.

- **Interview Questions**: A collection of DSA-related interview questions commonly asked in technical interviews. We provide explanations and solutions to help you prepare effectively.

- **Theoretical Documents**: Comprehensive documentation on DSA theories, concepts, and principles. This serves as a reference guide for understanding the underlying principles behind various data structures and algorithms.

### Code Examples

Our repository includes practical code examples to illustrate how to use data structures and implement algorithms in C++. These examples are designed to be beginner-friendly yet informative.

### Sorting Algorithms

We cover various sorting algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

Each sorting algorithm is explained, implemented in C++, and accompanied by clear code examples for better understanding.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Learning**: If you are new to DSA, start by exploring the theoretical documents to build a strong foundation. Then, dive into the code examples and implement data structures and algorithms from scratch.

- **Interview Preparation**: Use the interview questions section to practice and improve your problem-solving skills. Understand the logic behind each solution and try to solve them independently first.

- **Contributions**: We encourage contributions from the open-source community. Feel free to contribute your implementations, improvements, or additional topics to enhance the repository's value.
