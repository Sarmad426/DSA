# Dynamic Programming

**Dynamic Programming** is similar to Divide and Conquer in breaking down problem into sub-problems. But unlike divide and conquer sub-problems are not solved independently. Results are remembered and used for similar problems. The results can be reused. Mostly it is used for optimization.

## Examples

- Fibonacci Series
- Project Scheduling
- Knapsack problems
