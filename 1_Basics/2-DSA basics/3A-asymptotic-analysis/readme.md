# Asymptotic Analysis

Asymptotic analysis is defining the **Mathematical Boundation** of run-time performance. It is **input bound**, and if there is no input it is constant.

## Asymptotic Notations

1. **O** Notation (Big O)
2. **Omega** Notation
3. **Theta** Notation

### O Notation (Big O)

Expresses Upper bound of any algorithm's running time.
It measures the worst case time complexity.

### Omega Notation

Expresses lower bound of an algorithm. Measures best case.

### Theta Notation &theta;

Expresses both upper and lower bound of an algorithm.
