# Algorithms

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure that defines a set of instructions executed in a specific order to obtain a desired output. Algorithms are language-independent and can be implemented in multiple programming languages.

## Categories of Algorithms

From a data structure perspective, important categories of algorithms include:

- **Search**: Algorithm for searching an item in a data structure.
- **Sort**: Algorithm for arranging items in a specific order.
- **Insert**: Algorithm for adding an item to a data structure.
- **Update**: Algorithm for modifying an existing item in a data structure.
- **Delete**: Algorithm for removing an existing item from a data structure.

## Characteristics of an Algorithm

Not all procedures qualify as algorithms; an algorithm should possess the following characteristics:

- **Unambiguous**: The algorithm must be clear and unambiguous, with each step and its inputs/outputs having a single, definite meaning.
- **Input**: An algorithm should have zero or more well-defined inputs.
- **Output**: An algorithm should have one or more well-defined outputs that match the desired result.
- **Finiteness**: Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps.
- **Feasibility**: They should be achievable with available resources.
- **Independence**: Algorithms should provide step-by-step directions independent of any programming code.

Algorithms are typically written in a step-by-step manner, but this isn't always the case. Algorithm development occurs after clearly defining the problem domain.

Example: Adding Two Numbers
Let's learn algorithm-writing through an example: designing an algorithm to add two numbers and display the result.

Algorithm 1

START

1. Declare three integers: a, b, and c.
2. Define values for a and b.
3. Add the values of a and b.
4. Store the output of step 4 in c.
5. Print c.
6. STOP
7. Algorithm 2

### Another Example

1. START ADD
2. Get values of a and b.
3. Calculate c as a + b.
4. Display c.
5. STOP
In the design and analysis of algorithms, the second method is often used. It simplifies the analysis by focusing on the relevant operations. Including step numbers is optional.

Algorithms guide programmers in coding programs and provide a systematic approach to problem-solving. Keep in mind that multiple algorithms can solve the same problem in different ways.
